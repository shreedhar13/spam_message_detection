activate and deactivate virtual environment work in command prompt/shell so navigate cmd in vs code and 
execute myenv\Scripts\activate,,,myenv\Scripts\deactivate
in powershell which is bydefault CLI in vs code,,here above commands are not execute at all...so switch to cmd in vs code

and mention this file(my_info.txt ,and myenv folder )in .gitignore file so that when u push this repo
ie;SPAM_DETECTION_WEB_APP to Github then git push will ignore these file(ie;not push to github)

NOTE->bcz heroku stopped its free service,,so i am deploying this application on "render" ..which is hosting platform..
where it connects with ur github,,thus automatically CI/CD pipeline is created......as u push some changes in ur github w.r.t this already deployed application repo,,automatically changes is reflected in ur hosted website.....

IMP point-> after words do dockerization on this repo deploy it on docker hub  and then pull it in aws ECR...and launch ec2 instances...configure ci/cd in that (see krish naik video ...production level deployment)......
